## I want to get better with computing and more comfortbale with r. i took 206 over a year ago now and I feel like I have lost my coding/r skills already. if you dont use it you lose it. Really just hoping to pick up some skills that I can bring to whatever opportunity arises.

## My data science background is pretty limited. Stats with Allison and I took data management with Frew last year as well.Outside of classes, I did a small side project for someone where I took answers from a survey and created word clouds using R which I really enjoyed.
